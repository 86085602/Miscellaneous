# Spark for High Energy Physics

High energy physics is a data-intensive domain with a well-established set of tools and methods for data analysis.
In this page you can find links and examples on how to use Spark for reading and processing HEP data.
Relevant technology and links:
 * [spark-root](https://github.com/diana-hep/spark-root): read HEP files in ROOT format into Spark Data Frames using .
 * [CERN opendata portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/)
 * [CMS Bigdata project](https://cms-big-data.github.io)
