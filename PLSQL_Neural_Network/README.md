# An example of how to build a neural network scoring engine in PL/SQL

In this you will find the support material for the blog entry: 
This is an example of how to build and deploy a basic artificial neural network scoring engine using PL/SQL. It is intended for learning purposes, in particular for Oracle practitioners who want a hands-on introduction to neural networks.
